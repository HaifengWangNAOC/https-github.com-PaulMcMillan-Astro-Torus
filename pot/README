These are various parameters files to be used as input for a GalaxyPotential.

DB98Modx.Tpot (where x lies between 1 & 4) correspond to Model x from Dehnen & Binney (1998, MNRAS, 294, 429)

BT08.Tpot corresponds to Model I from Galactic Dynamics by Binney & Tremaine (second edition, Table 2.3)

PJM11_best.Tpot and PJM11_convenient.Tpot correspond to the 'best' and 'convenient' models from McMillan (2011, MNRAS, 414, 2446)

PJM14.Tpot corresponds to the best potential from McMillan (2014), once I get that finished.
